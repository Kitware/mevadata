<h1>MEVA Transcoding FAQ <small>Frequently Anticipated Questions</small></h1>

<h4>What is being proposed and why?</h4>
We are planning to replace all ground camera videos (from the
      school, admin, hospital, and bus nodes) with transcoded
      versions. The current videos were copied directly off the NVR
      units used during the original collect back in 2018. Some of
      these files contain errors which prevent software such as ffmpeg
      from, for example, seeking to random points in the video. The
      transcoded versions should have fewer errors and support
      seeking.

<h4>How have the videos been transcoded?</h4>
The general process was that each video was broken out into frames;
      these frames were then recombined back into the transcoded
      video. The script used is available at [link]. The DIVA
      performers and evaluation team conducted several rounds of
      experiments before settling on the final transcoding parameters,
      which are:
<ul>
<li> fastdecode (a libx264 parameter)
<li> crf 25
<li> 60 frames (2 seconds) between I-frames
<li> pixel format of yuv420p
</ul>

<h4>How does this affect the annotations?</h4>
For annotations generated by Kitware for Test and Evaluation and our 'meva-training' effort, very little if at all. Our annotation process starts with the same process of breaking the video into frames; thus the annotations and transcoded video are starting from the same data source.
