<h1>MEVA Transcoding FAQ <small>Frequently Anticipated Questions</small></h1>

<br><h4>What is being proposed and why?</h4>
We are planning to replace all ground camera videos (from the
      school, admin, hospital, and bus nodes) with transcoded
      versions. The current videos were copied directly off the NVR
      units used during the original collect back in 2018. Some of
      these files contain errors which prevent software such as ffmpeg
      from, for example, seeking to random points in the video. The
      transcoded versions should have fewer errors in general and support
      seeking in particular.

<br><h4>What format are the transcoded videos?</h4>
The transcoded videos are still H.264 in an AVI container.

<br><h4>How have the videos been transcoded?</h4>
The general process was that each video was broken out into frames;
      these frames were then recombined back into the transcoded
      video. The script used is available at [link]. The DIVA
      performers and evaluation team conducted several rounds of
      experiments before settling on the final transcoding parameters,
      which are:
<ul>
<li> fastdecode (a <a
  href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264">libx264 tuning parameter</a>)
<li> crf 25
<li> 60 frames (2 seconds) between I-frames
<li> pixel format of yuv420p
</ul>

<br><h4>How does this affect the annotations?</h4>
For annotations generated by Kitware for Test and Evaluation and our 'meva-training' effort, very little if at all. Our annotation process starts with the same process of breaking the video into frames; thus the annotations and transcoded video are starting from the same data source.

<br><h4>How do I know if I'm working with a recoded video?</h4>
<br><h4>How do the recoded videos compare to the originals? [ stats ]</h4>
<br><h4>Will the originals still be available? [ yes, just not on mevadata.org ]</h4>
<br><h4>How does this affect the ActEV competition? [ NIST is already using identically recoded videos on their SDL ]</h4>
<br><h4>Does this affect the UAV videos? [ no, only the ground cameras. ]</h4>
<br><h4>Will every video be recoded? [ No, a few had unrecoverable recoding errors. ]</h4>
<br><h4>Are additional videos being released at this time? [ No. ]</h4>
<br><h4>How can I obtain the samples?</h4>
<br><h4>What next?</h4>
