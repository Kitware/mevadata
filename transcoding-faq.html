<h1>MEVA Transcoding FAQ <small>Frequently Anticipated Questions</small></h1>

<h3>Q: What is being proposed and why?</h3>
<h4>A: We are planning to replace all ground camera videos (from the
      school, admin, hospital, and bus nodes) with transcoded
      versions. The current videos were copied directly off the NVR
      units used during the original collect back in 2018. Some of
      these files contain errors which prevent software such as ffmpeg
      from for example, seeking to random points in the video. The
      transcoded versions should have fewer errors and support
      seeking.<h4>
      


<h3>Q: Why is it happening?</h3>

Lots of reasons.
