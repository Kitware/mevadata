<H1>Multiview Extended Video with Activities (MEVA) Dataset README</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The MEVA dataset was collected as part of the Intelligence Advanced
Research Projects Activity (IARPA) <a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/diva">DIVA program</a>. It is
designed to support performers on the DIVA program and the broader
research community focused on activity detection in data from
simultaneous, multi-camera environments.<p>

The data was collected using a variety of commercial, off-the-shelf
cameras to replicate equipment used in typical real-world
environments. The data may therefore include irregularities not seen
in high-end, research-grade video data. Camera G639 has been rotated. We are planning a transition to transcoded data; see <a href="../transcoding-faq.html">the transcoding FAQ</a> for more details.<p>

<h2>Access</h2>

The MEVA Known Facility Dataset 1 ("KF1") is approximately 330 hours
of video across 4001 video clips totalling 470 GB. It is available via
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) via a no-cost download sponsored by
Amazon's AWS Public Dataset Program. The s3 bucket name is <tt>mevadata-public-01</tt>.<p>

Several command line tools and GUI clients are available for
downloading from S3, e.g. s3cmd, available at
<a href="https://s3tools.org/s3cmd">https://s3tools.org/s3cmd</a>. Once installed, commands similar to<p>

<pre>
$ aws s3 sync s3://mevadata-public-01/drops-123-r13 .
</pre>

...will synchronize the ground camera 'drops-123-r13' directory into the current directory.<p>

Kitware does not endorse or warrant the utility of any particular S3
client.  Your use of Amazon S3 is subject to Amazon's Terms of
Use. The accessibility of the MEVA KF1 data from Amazon S3 is provided
"as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular use. Please do not contact Kitware for

<h2>Directory Structure & Filenames</h2>

The data directory structure is:

<pre>
[root]
├── drops-123-r13
├── drop-4-hadcv22
├── examples
├── mutc-3d-model
├── uav-drop-01
└── updates-r13
</pre>

The directory contents are:

<ul>
  <li><b>drops-123-r13</b> : Ground camera video; 3956 clips / 444 GB / 324.2 hours
  <li><b>drop-4-hadcv22</b> : Ground camera video; 201 clips / 28 GB / 16.75 hours
  <li><b>examples</b> : Example annotations of DIVA activities
  <li><b>mutc-3d-model</b> : 3D point cloud model of the collection venue
  <li><b>uav-drop-01</b> : UAV video
  <li><b>updates-r13</b> : Ground camera videos us in the ActEV leaderboard which were overlooked in the original drops
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>NOTE REGARDING USE OF THE HADCV22 DATA</h3>
The drop-4-hadcv22 data is provided for use with the <a href="https://actev.nist.gov/SRL">HADCV22 Self-Reported Leaderboard Challenge</a>. This data should <b>not</b> be used for training any submissions to the <a href="https://actev.nist.gov"</a>NIST ActEV</a> leaderboards.
<hr>

<p>
The original ground camera data was staged in three drops. As of 20
June 2021, these videos have been transcoded and are available in a
single directory;  see <a href="transcoding-faq.html">the transcoding
FAQ</a> for more details.

Ground camera video directories follow a video/facility/date/hour/video
clip structure. Ground camera video files are typically five minutes in length, and
filenames have the following structure:<p>

<pre>
YYYY-MM-DD.timestamp-start.timestamp-end.camera-location.camera-number
</pre>

For example, the filename <tt>2018-03-07.16-50-00.16-55-00.admin.G329.r13.avi</tt> is parsed as:
<ul>
<li>Recorded started on March 7, 2018 starting at 16:50:00.
<li>Recording ended at 16:55:00.
<li>The camera was located in/on the admin building (see metadata, below).
<li>The camera number was G329.
<li>This clip has been  <a href="transcoding-faq.html">transcoded per
  the 'r13' process</a>.
</ul>

The video data is organized into a four-level hierarchy of facility
id, date, then hour, then videos. Ground-camera data was recorded on several NAS
units whose clocks were synchronized via GPS. The NAS software was
configured to record five-minute clips; however, clips do not all
necessarily start or stop on even five-minute boundaries. A few clips
may be shorter than five minutes due to transmission errors or
collection event anomalies. Some clips were
collected at the beginning of the event and may be shorter than five
minutes.<p>

UAV data was collected by a pair of DJI drones at 3840x2160 @ 30fps;
more details can be found in the UAV data readme at <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mevadata-public-01/uav-drop-01/meva-uav-drop-01-readme.pdf">https://s3.amazonaws.com/mevadata-public-01/uav-drop-01/meva-uav-drop-01-readme.pdf</a>.

<h3>Dataset updates</h3>
<div id="dataset-updates"></div>

<ul>
<li><b>20 June 2021</b>: The ground camera videos have been transcoded; see <a href="transcoding-faq.html">the transcoding
FAQ</a> for more details.

<li><b>29 April 2020</b>: Two dataset updates:
<li>A block of 130 video clips from camera G328 were identified as
corrupted, and have been removed. The clips are from 2018-03-05,
between 10:10:16 and 11:23:54am.

<li>Camera G639 was mounted sideways. The 83 videos on AWS have been
replaced with rotated versions so that up in the world is also up in
the video. 
</ul>
The complete list of affected videos may be found at <a href="http://mevadata.org/resources/update-20200429.txt">http://mevadata.org/resources/update-20200429.txt</a>.
